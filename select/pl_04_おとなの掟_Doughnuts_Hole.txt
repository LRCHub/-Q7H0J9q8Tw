Sighs in the blackest black abiding,
as soon as one dies, one is rising
With the night so dark and cold,
the wishes I make are swallowed up
and hidden away
Breath of the whitest white is
what I most wish to say down deep now inside
Can a voice so numb and cold
have some song to sing?
It could be false, or reality
The things I like, or hate,
or things I want to gain
Whatever's feeling good is
what my lines would say
For setting off the black from white,
it'd work perfectly
Though like a chant of ruination it'd be
Why did I think that
since I'd studied the latest schoolbook
I'd know clearly
What's right from what's wrong,
and which is which one, that I could choose,
I could really know?
I live according to
stage-right, stage-left, exit
Improvisation's not been in my bag of tricks
So much of what I want to say pours out noisily
But never when you're not here alone with me
What I know that I hold in my hands
I want to set free, think of how much lighter
you and I would feel then
Every word, every wall, every curse
and sparing nothing, strip it,
take it all away to once again see eye to eye
The things I like, or hate,
or things I want, expect,
Though if I let them out,
I think, what happens next?
Well, setting off the white
from black is fearful indeed
It's even more so when you live honestly
This life is long, so long,
the world is wide, I say,
And when we've freedom won,
it all becomes one gray
Yes, happiness, unhappiness, it's only the heart
That knows no quietude that makes itself known
while an adult can keep a secret alone
